## General Budgeting Tips for Pakistan:

1.  **Currency:** The local currency is the **Pakistani Rupee (PKR)**. You'll get a very favorable exchange rate from AED/USD. At the time of writing (late 2023/early 2024), 1 USD is roughly 275-285 PKR.
2.  **Exchange Money:** It's best to exchange money at authorized money changers or banks upon arrival. Avoid exchanging at the airport for the best rates. ATMs are available but might have withdrawal limits.
3.  **Book in Advance:** Flights and popular hotels are cheaper when booked a few weeks or months in advance.
4.  **Travel Season:** Peak season (October-March) might have higher prices. Off-peak (summer) can be very hot but cheaper.
5.  **Negotiate:** For rickshaws, taxis (if not using apps), and in local bazaars, negotiation is common and expected.
6.  **Local SIM Card:** Purchase a local SIM card (e.g., Jazz, Zong, Telenor, Ufone) upon arrival for cheap data and calls. Essential for ride-hailing apps.
7.  **Water:** Drink bottled water only.
8.  **Contingency Fund:** Always keep an extra 10-15% of your total budget for unexpected expenses or splurges.
9.  **Safety:** While generally safe for tourists, it's always wise to be aware of your surroundings, especially in crowded areas. Avoid walking alone late at night.
10. **Travel Insurance:** Highly recommended for any international trip.

Enjoy your trip to Pakistan!</li></ul>
